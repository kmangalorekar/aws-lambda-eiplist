# AWS EIP List

## Overview
The purpose of this document is to outline the process for listing all EIPs(Elastic IP addresses) used in all AWS accounts via a lambda script that queries data from AWS config. The output CSV report listing all resources, tags, and parameters attached to the EIPs facilitates any investigations from the Security team reducing the manual effort to search for the EIP and its resource links manually.
